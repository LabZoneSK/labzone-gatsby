Landing Page Wireframe + Copy
Hero Section

Headline (H1):
Your Hosting Stops Noise. LabZone Stops WordPress Exploits.

Subheadline (H2):
Generic hosting security blocks bots and spam. But 96% of WordPress vulnerabilities are in plugins ‚Äî and those slip right past hosting defenses.

LabZone‚Äôs WordPress Security Shield protects nonprofits from the real threats that take down sites and compromise donor trust.

Problem Section (The Gap)

Header:
Why Nonprofits Are at Risk on WordPress

Body Copy:

96% of vulnerabilities are in plugins, not WordPress core.

Hosting firewalls block only 12% of WordPress-specific exploits.

On a multisite, one vulnerability can compromise every site in your network.

For nonprofits, a single breach can damage donor confidence, interrupt services, and cost thousands in recovery. Security is mission protection.

Visual Idea: Infographic showing: Hosting Security = Generic Attacks Blocked / WordPress Security Shield = Plugin Exploits Stopped.

Styling / Design Notes

Use bold contrasting CTA buttons (e.g., teal or green) against neutral nonprofit-friendly branding.

Each plan card should highlight value with a ‚ÄúMost Popular‚Äù tag on Advanced Shield.

Include subtle trust badges (SSL, secure checkout, NGO partners).

Keep copy concise, benefit-driven, and trust-building.
